# Graph Assignment for Introduction to Data Structure Class (CS 46B)
As a way to introduce the concept of graphs and their versatility, a Graph program is created to model a generic airline company's air route. Two classes are provided and require some methods to be created. A "grader" class is also created to test the program. The first class, Airport, creates an airport given a name for the airport (given as a String), the airport's x-coordinate (given as an int), and the airport's y-coordinate (given as an int). The second class is the FlightNet class. This class deals with connecting and disconnecting airport routes as well as determining which airport is at a certain distance from a given xy-coordinate. 
## About the Assignment
The Airport class requires creating two methods: connectTo(Airport that) and disconnectFrom(Airport that). The FlightNet class, which extends to <HashSet> Airport, requires creating five methods:  boolean nameIsAvailable(String name), connect(Airport a1, Airport a2), disconnect(Airport a1, Airport a2), removeAndDisconnect(Airport removeMe), and getAirportNearXY(int x, int y, int maximumDistance). These classes work together to model a program that helps the user create routes between airports.
